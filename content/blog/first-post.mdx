## Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post! This post is written in **MDX**, which lets me combine standard Markdown with custom React components.

When I was buidling the site I decided I wanted to have a terminal aesthetic. In addition, I didn't want the website to feel basic or generic, so I took a lot of insparation from the tool [sniffnet](https://sniffnet.net/).

### Site Structure

The main page functions like a dashboard with several sections:

*   **Home:** The landing view with the command terminal and a brief intro.
*   **Projects:** Displays cards linking to detailed descriptions of my work.
*   **Experience:** A log of my work history and significant involvements.
*   **Skills:** A matrix visualizing my proficiency across different technologies. (based on my confidence)
*   **Contact:** A form to get in touch.
*   **Blog:** (You are here!) Where I will write about tech, projects, and more.

### Technology Stack

This site is built using modern web technologies:

1.  **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
2.  **React:** The core JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
3.  **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
4.  **MDX:** Allows embedding React components within Markdown for rich content like this blog.
5.  **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript for better code quality and maintainability.


### Content

When I was deciding what projects to include I didn't want to include my most recent projects, but the projects I felt that represented overall what I was doing at that time and my growth.
